# Stock-Trading-Bot

main.py contains the program that when run will check to see if it should buy/sell stock on Forward Industries.  To see the model I am using see: https://github.com/snickers2524/Deep-Learning-Stock-Trading-Model.  To set up this simple stock trading bot, I am using an AWS EC2 and MySQL instance to execute and manage the program autonomously.

However, because this is an initial program I wrote to get an understanding of the interactive broker API, and all things that could factor into it.  Like speed, memory issues etc, I wont be delving more into how to run this etc as I plan to effectively blow it up and develop a much more sophisticated program.  I.e. multi-thread, far more models etc.  I have for sure decided not to use AWS to the memory and processor requirements of a comprehensive stock trading program.  For instance, deep learning models are large, and constantly having to load them into memory is way to slow in a high-frequency trading model.  Thus, AWS is out simply because it is way to expensive to have a powerful ec2 instance going with gpus etc.  Basically ill be using my own desktop to run it, but will push the updated program here in the future.
